"The study of NYC crime is of broad interest in the Urban Science scene, and NYPD has provided statistics on the crime (by precinct) for several years. This is an important resource to understand and analyze urban crime. There are obvious connections between crime and wealth, which relate both to access to precious goods (opportunity), and to how easy it is to commit a crime (the neighborhood safety, or perceived safety). [It has been suggested](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/unemployment-property-crime-burglary) that unemployment correlates strongly with burglary for example, due to both opportunity and motivation. In addition there are [several pieces of research](https://www.citylab.com/solutions/2016/04/vacant-lots-green-space-crime-research-statistics/476040/) that indicate that access to green spaces affects crime.\n",

    "In this program we explore and model NYC crime:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first part is an exploratory analysis of the crime time series for the seven major felonies 2000-2016 (temporal domain).


"- The second part attempts to relate socioeconomic features to individual crime rates by area (spatial domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lastly,we aggregate the socioeconomic features that I indicated at the precinct level: percentage of unemployment and median income, that natively come at the census tract level from the census bureau API, and green area, for which we use the NYC parks shapefile.\n",
